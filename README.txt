This module provides a Variable Field to include in Views.

Installation
------------

1. Normal Drupal module installation

Usage
------------
This module provides a new Global field type for Views which enables site
builders to add any Drupal variable as a field in a view.

Usage is straight forward. Select "Global: Drupal variable" in
the Views available field list and then enter the name of the variable to
display. VVF module allows to use dynamic variable names using default views
replacement patterns. You can also rewrite the output value or use
the default Views' "No results behavior" feature as in any other field.
